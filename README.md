# ZustCart
A full-stack MERN shopping cart application built to understand and implement Zustand for global state management in a real-world scenario. The application allows users to browse products, add or remove items from the cart, and view the total price with persistent cart state.

This project demonstrates how Zustand simplifies state management compared to traditional solutions like Redux.
